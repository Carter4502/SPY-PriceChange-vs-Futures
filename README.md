# SPY-PriceChange-vs-Futures
For this project I tried to see if there was a correlation between the change in the prices for the futures of SPY the previous day and the change in the price for the day after. (Basically asking the quesition: can a change in the futures of spy tell you that the next day the stock will go up or down?) The graph showed no real correlation so my conclusion is no.
