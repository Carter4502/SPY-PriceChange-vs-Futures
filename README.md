# SPY-PriceChange-vs-Futures
For this project I tried to see if there was a correlation between the change in the prices for the futures of SPY the previous day and the change in the price for the day after. (Basically asking the quesition: can a change in the futures of spy tell you that the next day the stock will go up or down?) The graph showed no real correlation so my conclusion is no however this could maybe be used with more data then a month to see if there is a trend yearly or by decade.
